# A-Neural-Network-Model-for-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis

Abstract

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer in women around the world. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis method that can help detect breast cancer is crucial to battle this disease type. Among numerous learning models introduced to predict breast cancer diagnosis, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has emerged as crucial  research in the data mining field in recent decades. This project's purpose is to propose a simple but powerful classification method with very high accuracy. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, a series of six experiments are conducted using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer data set. Besides full feature input, feature selection and extraction are considered to observe their potential impact on model performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed model works excellently with the full features as well as the extracted feature inputs using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), achieving an accurate rate of 99.1%. Moreover, the proposed model results also outperform other machine learning methods such as Random Forest Classifier.  Based on the finding,  the proposed model can be developed as a promising tool to support doctors in their making cancer diagnosis process.
